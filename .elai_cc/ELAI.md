# ELAI.md

This file provides guidance to ELAI when working with code in this repository.

## Detected stack
- Languages: Rust.
- Frameworks: none detected from the supported starter markers.

## Verification
- Run Rust verification from the repo root: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`
- `src/` and `tests/` are both present; update both surfaces together when behavior changes.

## Repository shape
- `src/` contains source files that should stay consistent with generated guidance and tests.
- `tests/` contains validation surfaces that should be reviewed alongside code changes.

## Working agreement
- Prefer small, reviewable changes and keep generated bootstrap files aligned with actual repo workflows.
- Keep shared defaults in `.elai.json`; reserve `.elai/settings.local.json` for machine-local overrides.
- Do not overwrite existing `ELAI.md` content automatically; update it intentionally when repo workflows change.
